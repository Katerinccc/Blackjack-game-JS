# Blackjack game by console in Javascript.

> This project creates a game of Blackjacj that can be run in the terminal of your preference. The game was made 100% using Javacript.

The project has three modules to create three types of objects. First players, second cards, and the third is the deck of cards for the game. The deck of cards consists of 52 cards with 13 values and four suits.
In the index.js there are the methods to execute the program. The main menu has two options, the first one is to create new players, and the second option is to play Blackjack.
Note: `A player needs to be registered first to be able to play .`
The player can win the game if they get a score higher or equal to 18 and less or equal to 21. The game cards are generated automatically (validating that the new card draw doesn't already exist in the game). For each time that a player win they earn 1,000USD. The price is accumulative in the same session, but when the game finishs (because the player loses or decides to finish), the prize restart to 0.
